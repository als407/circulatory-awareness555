        <h2>What is the Circulatory System?</h2>
        <p>The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is a complex network of blood vessels that transports blood, nutrients, gases, and waste products throughout the body. It includes the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. This system plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and supporting the overall health of the body.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="functions" class="section">
        <h2>Key Functions of the Circulatory System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transport of Oxygen:</strong> The circulatory system delivers oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrient Distribution:</strong> It transports nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and lipids from the digestive system to various cells in the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Waste Removal:</strong> It helps in removing waste products such as urea and toxins from the body through the kidneys and other excretory organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> Blood flow helps in maintaining body temperature by distributing heat across the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Immune Response:</strong> White blood cells in the blood circulate throughout the body to fight infections and diseases.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Tips for Maintaining a Healthy Circulatory System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Engaging in physical activities like walking, cycling, or swimming improves heart health and blood circulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats helps keep your blood vessels and heart healthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> Smoking damages blood vessels and increases the risk of heart disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Chronic stress can negatively affect your circulatory health. Practice stress-relieving techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drinking enough water helps maintain the proper flow of blood and supports overall circulatory health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts About the Circulatory System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The human circulatory system contains about 60,000 miles of blood vessels!</li>
            <li>Your heart beats around 100,000 times a day, pumping about 2,000 gallons of blood through your body.</li>
            <li>The circulatory system is responsible for supplying your body with oxygen and nutrients, which are essential for survival.</li>
            <li>The heart pumps blood to every cell in the body in just about one minute.</li>
